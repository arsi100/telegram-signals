Detailed Project Report: Cryptocurrency Trading Signal Application
Completed Work
1. Project Structure
Established modular project architecture with separate functions
Created main Flask application with informational interface
Set up Firebase integration with service account
Implemented error handling and optimized logging throughout the codebase (Dec 2024: Optimized verbosity in technical analysis to reduce Cloud Function logs from ~12K lines to <100 lines per execution)
2. Web Interface
Created responsive Bootstrap-based interface using Replit's dark theme
Added status checking endpoint to verify Firebase connection
Implemented informational landing page explaining application features
3. API Integrations
Kraken API:
Implemented REST API endpoints for fetching cryptocurrency market data (`kraken_api.py`)
Created error handling for API failures
Firebase:
Set up Firestore database connection
Configured service account authentication
Created database integration for storing signals and positions
Telegram:
Implemented bot integration for signal delivery
Created message formatting for trading signals
Added startup notification functionality
Google Gemini:
Implemented API for confidence score calculation
Created fallback algorithm when API is unavailable
Added detailed prompt engineering for accuracy
4. Core Functionality
Signal Generation: Basic framework for technical analysis (`technical_analysis.py` using `pandas-ta`) and signal detection (`signal_generator.py`). Recent KeyErrors related to data access between these modules have been addressed.
Position Management: System for tracking open positions and calculating profits
Configuration: Modular configuration with environment variables support
Error Handling: Comprehensive logging and error recovery with optimized verbosity for production deployment
Pending Tasks
1. API Key Configuration
Required API Keys:
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID (for sending signals)
GEMINI_API_KEY (for confidence score calculation)
CRYPTOCOMPARE_API_KEY (backup data source)
KRAKEN_API_KEY (if private endpoints are needed; public Kline data currently used)
2. Implementation Completion
Technical Analysis: Verify pattern detection and confirmation logic in `technical_analysis.py` (using `pandas-ta`) aligns with strategy. Ensure strategic market hour considerations are integrated if desired.
Signal Generator: Rigorously test `signal_generator.py` to ensure all strict conditions from `Trading Signal Application.md` are correctly implemented and evaluated.
Position Manager: Finalize position tracking with profit calculation.
Cloud Functions: Confirm stability of the deployed Cloud Function (`run_signal_generation`) after recent bug fixes.
3. Testing and Validation
Perform end-to-end testing with real API credentials
Validate signal generation with historical data
Test Telegram message delivery
Verify Firebase data storage and retrieval
4. Deployment
Deploy to Firebase Cloud Functions
Set up Cloud Scheduler for periodic execution
Configure Firebase security rules
Document deployment process for future reference
Next Steps Recommendation
1. Confirm stability of the current Cloud Function deployment (commit `ace1248`) by checking logs.
2. Provide API keys for external services to complete integration and full E2E testing (especially Gemini, and Kraken if authenticated endpoints become necessary).
3. Test end-to-end workflow with real credentials and verify signal logic against `Trading Signal Application.md`.
4. Deploy to Firebase Cloud Functions for production use after thorough validation.
