Detailed Project Report: Cryptocurrency Trading Signal Application
Completed Work
1. Project Structure
Established modular project architecture with separate functions
Created main Flask application with informational interface
Set up Firebase integration with service account
Implemented error handling and logging throughout the codebase
2. Web Interface
Created responsive Bootstrap-based interface using Replit's dark theme
Added status checking endpoint to verify Firebase connection
Implemented informational landing page explaining application features
3. API Integrations
Bybit API:
Implemented REST API endpoints for fetching cryptocurrency market data
Added WebSocket integration as an alternative for real-time updates
Created error handling for API failures
Firebase:
Set up Firestore database connection
Configured service account authentication
Created database integration for storing signals and positions
Telegram:
Implemented bot integration for signal delivery
Created message formatting for trading signals
Added startup notification functionality
Google Gemini:
Implemented API for confidence score calculation
Created fallback algorithm when API is unavailable
Added detailed prompt engineering for accuracy
4. Core Functionality
Signal Generation: Framework for technical analysis and signal detection
Position Management: System for tracking open positions and calculating profits
Configuration: Modular configuration with environment variables support
Error Handling: Comprehensive logging and error recovery
Pending Tasks
1. API Key Configuration
Required API Keys:
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID (for sending signals)
GEMINI_API_KEY (for confidence score calculation)
CRYPTOCOMPARE_API_KEY (backup data source)
2. Implementation Completion
Technical Analysis: Finish implementing pattern detection algorithms
Signal Generator: Complete signal generation logic with pattern recognition
Position Manager: Finalize position tracking with profit calculation
Cloud Functions: Complete Firebase Cloud Functions integration
3. Testing and Validation
Perform end-to-end testing with real API credentials
Validate signal generation with historical data
Test Telegram message delivery
Verify Firebase data storage and retrieval
4. Deployment
Deploy to Firebase Cloud Functions
Set up Cloud Scheduler for periodic execution
