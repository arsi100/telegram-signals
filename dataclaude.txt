I can see you've been struggling with a deployment issue for 4 months, and it's clearly incredibly frustrating. The conversation you've shared shows a pattern I've seen many times - where the code works locally but deployment issues keep preventing the fixes from actually taking effect.

Let me search for some current information about common deployment cache issues and solutions that might help break through this problem:Let me search for more specific information about deployment cache issues and solutions:Based on your situation and the search results, I can see you're dealing with a classic deployment cache issue that's preventing your code fixes from actually being deployed. Here are several proven strategies to solve this problem:

## Immediate Solutions to Try:

### 1. **Force Complete Cache Bypass in Cloud Build**
Your approach of deleting services is good, but you should also add `--no-cache` to your Cloud Build:

```bash
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild-micro.yaml . --no-cache --substitutions="_NO_CACHE=true"
```

### 2. **Use Build Arguments for Cache Busting**
Instead of just adding timestamp comments, use Docker build arguments in your `cloudbuild-micro.yaml`:

```yaml
steps:
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: ['build', '-t', '$_IMAGE_NAME', '--build-arg', 'CACHEBUST=${BUILD_ID}', '.']
```

Then in your Dockerfile, add:
```dockerfile
ARG CACHEBUST=1
RUN echo "Cache bust: ${CACHEBUST}"
```

### 3. **Complete Image Tag Strategy**
Use the --no-cache option to disable caching or use a custom Docker build argument to enforce rebuilding from a certain step. Instead of using latest or build IDs, use completely unique image tags:

```bash
IMAGE_TAG="manual-fix-$(date +%s)"
```

### 4. **Nuclear Option - Complete Artifact Registry Cleanup**
Since you're already deleting services, also clean up the container registry:

```bash
# List all images
gcloud container images list --repository=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/telegram-signals-205cc/cloud-run-source-deploy

# Delete all old images
gcloud container images delete IMAGE_URL --force-delete-tags --quiet
```

## Why This is Happening:

The issue you're experiencing is unfortunately common with Google Cloud Build and Docker layer caching. Docker determines whether a layer needs to be rebuilt or fetched from the cache based on a checksum of the instruction and its context, and sometimes this cache gets stuck in an inconsistent state.

## Recommended Debugging Steps:

1. **Verify your code is actually in the git repo** - Do a fresh clone to make sure your commits actually made it
2. **Check the actual built image** - Pull the deployed image locally and verify it contains your fixes
3. **Use explicit image digests** - Instead of tags, use the SHA256 digest of your built image

## Long-term Prevention:

For future deployments, consider:
- Using semantic versioning for your images instead of build IDs
- Adding health checks that verify your actual code version is running
- Setting up a staging environment that exactly mirrors production

The 4-month timeframe you mentioned is definitely not normal - this should be solvable. The nuclear option approach you're taking (deleting all services) combined with forcing a complete rebuild should work, but make sure to also clear the image registry cache.
