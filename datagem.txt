I completely understand your frustration. Four months is an incredibly long time to be stuck on a deployment, and it's demoralizing when solutions that *should* work repeatedly fail to deploy. The behavior you're seeing – the service running old code despite multiple deployments and cache-busting attempts – is highly unusual and points to a deeper, systemic issue within the Google Cloud Run environment or your project's configuration.

The "nuclear option" of deleting and redeploying all services is indeed the correct and often necessary step when you encounter such persistent, inexplicable deployment failures. It effectively clears out any corrupted state, old revisions, and potentially cached images that are preventing new code from being picked up.

**Let's confirm the plan and the rationale:**

**Problem Confirmed:**

1.  **Code Not Updating:** The logs unequivocally show the `ws.subscribe()` error and `RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'start_data_ingestion' was never awaited`, indicating that the *previous* code is still active, not your latest fixes.
2.  **Deployment Pipeline Failure:** Your cache-busting attempts (adding comments to Dockerfile, etc.) are not working, meaning Cloud Build is still using an old image or Cloud Run isn't pulling the new image correctly.

**Rationale for "Nuclear Option":**

  * **Complete State Reset:** Deleting the services completely removes all associated revisions, configurations, and potentially any lingering cached images within Cloud Run for those specific service names.
  * **Forced Fresh Start:** When you redeploy, Cloud Run is forced to create entirely new services, pulling the latest built image from Artifact Registry. This bypasses any previous internal caching or revision management issues.
  * **Isolation of Issues:** If, *after* a complete delete and redeploy, you still see the old code, it would point to an issue with Cloud Build itself (i.e., it's not building the correct image) or Artifact Registry (it's not storing or serving the latest image). But for now, the Cloud Run service itself is the prime suspect for holding onto old versions.

**Your Action (Deletion):**
You've initiated the deletion of all four micro-scalp services:

  * `micro-scalp-ingestion`
  * `micro-scalp-processor`
  * `micro-scalp-logic`
  * `micro-scalp-notifier`

This is precisely the right move.

**Next Steps (After Deletion Completes):**

Once the deletion commands confirm successful removal of all services (which might take a minute or two), your very next step is to **re-run the full deployment command that includes the `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, and `gcloud builds submit` and `gcloud run deploy` for all services.**

**Crucial considerations for the redeployment:**

1.  **Verify the local code:** Before you re-run the deployment, just do a quick final check of your local `micro_scalp_engine/data_ingestion.py` and `micro_scalp_engine/service_wrapper.py` files to ensure they contain all the intended fixes (`ticker_stream` and `asyncio.run`). Also, confirm the timestamp comment is still in `micro_scalp_engine/Dockerfile.unified`.

2.  **Ensure no existing services:** Double-check in the Cloud Console or with `gcloud run services list --region=us-central1` that *all* `micro-scalp` services are gone before you attempt the re-deployment. This ensures a clean slate.

3.  **Run the full deployment command:** The command you provided previously:

    ```bash
    git add micro_scalp_engine/data_ingestion.py micro_scalp_engine/service_wrapper.py micro_scalp_engine/Dockerfile.unified && git commit -m "FIX: Final attempt - Fix async exec, websocket method, and bust cache" && git push && \
    BUILD_ID=$(gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild-micro.yaml . --gcs-source-staging-dir=gs://telegram-signals-205cc_cloudbuild/source --project=telegram-signals-205cc --region=us-central1 --format='value(id)' --suppress-logs) && \
    echo "Build complete. Got BUILD_ID: ${BUILD_ID}" && \
    IMAGE="us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/telegram-signals-205cc/cloud-run-source-deploy/micro-scalp:${BUILD_ID}" && \
    echo "--- FINAL DEPLOYMENT with IMAGE: ${IMAGE} ---\" && \
    gcloud run deploy micro-scalp-ingestion --image=$IMAGE --platform=managed --region=us-central1 --no-allow-unauthenticated --set-env-vars="SERVICE_TYPE=ingestion" --min-instances=1 --quiet && \
    gcloud run deploy micro-scalp-processor --image=$IMAGE --platform=managed --region=us-central1 --no-allow-unauthenticated --set-env-vars="SERVICE_TYPE=processor" --min-instances=1 --quiet && \
    gcloud run deploy micro-scalp-logic --image=$IMAGE --platform=managed --region=us-central1 --no-allow-unauthenticated --set-env-vars="SERVICE_TYPE=logic" --min-instances=1 --quiet && \
    gcloud run deploy micro-scalp-notifier --image=$IMAGE --platform=managed --region=us-central1 --no-allow-unauthenticated --set-env-vars="SERVICE_TYPE=notifier" --min-instances=1 --quiet && \
    echo "--- ALL SERVICES DEPLOYED ---"
    ```

    This command is crucial because it includes the `gcloud builds submit` which builds a *new* image (especially with the cache-busting Dockerfile change) and then uses that specific `BUILD_ID` to deploy all services.

**I have confidence that this comprehensive delete-and-redeploy strategy will finally get your latest code running.** This is a common and effective, albeit aggressive, way to clear out stubborn deployment issues in managed serverless environments.

Let me know as soon as the deletion commands complete, and we'll proceed with the re-deployment.
