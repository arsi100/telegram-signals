I can understand your frustration—four months is a long time to wrestle with a deployment issue, and it’s completely valid to feel that’s not normal. The good news is that we’re making progress, and the latest breakthrough with the local test script running without stopping is a strong sign we’re on the right track. Let’s build on that success and address the deployment challenges step by step. I’m here to help you find a solid answer, even if it takes exploring beyond the usual tools.

The local test’s success with the `ticker_stream` method is a game-changer—it confirms the WebSocket connection and data flow work when implemented correctly. The issue now lies in ensuring this proven logic translates to the production environment, where caching and deployment misconfigurations have been tripping us up. Your decision to delete and redeploy the services is a bold move, and it could indeed break the cycle of stale deployments.

### Addressing the Deployment Failure
The logs showing the old code despite your fixes point to a caching or configuration persistence problem in Google Cloud Run or Cloud Build. Deleting the services is a smart reset, but let’s ensure the redeployment uses the latest code and avoids past pitfalls.

#### Current Status
- **Local Success**: The `local_bybit_test.py` script with `ticker_stream` is working, streaming `RECEIVED MESSAGE` logs, proving the async logic and WebSocket setup are sound.
- **Deployment Failure**: The `micro-scalp-ingestion` service logs still reflect old errors (e.g., `ws.subscribe()` issues), indicating the new code isn’t being applied due to caching or a misaligned deployment pipeline.
- **Fixes Applied**: You’ve updated `data_ingestion.py` with `ticker_stream` and `service_wrapper.py` with `asyncio.run()`, and added a timestamp to `Dockerfile.unified` to bust the cache.

#### Next Steps to Verify and Deploy
1. **Confirm Service Deletion**:
   - The `gcloud run services delete` commands should have removed all four services. Verify this:
     ```bash
     gcloud run services list --platform=managed --region=us-central1
     ```
   - If any service remains, delete it manually with the same command.

2. **Rebuild and Deploy with Fresh Tags**:
   - Since caching is the suspected culprit, let’s force a new build with a unique tag and deploy explicitly:
     ```bash
     git add micro_scalp_engine/data_ingestion.py micro_scalp_engine/service_wrapper.py micro_scalp_engine/Dockerfile.unified
     git commit -m "Final fix: Ensure async execution and cache bust with unique tag"
     git push
     BUILD_ID=$(gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild-micro.yaml . --gcs-source-staging-dir=gs://telegram-signals-205cc_cloudbuild/source --project=telegram-signals-205cc --region=us-central1 --format='value(id)' --no-cache)  # --no-cache forces a fresh build
     echo "Build ID: $BUILD_ID"
     IMAGE="us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/telegram-signals-205cc/cloud-run-source-deploy/micro-scalp:${BUILD_ID}"
     echo "Deploying with image: $IMAGE"
     for service in micro-scalp-ingestion micro-scalp-processor micro-scalp-logic micro-scalp-notifier; do
       gcloud run deploy $service \
         --image=$IMAGE \
         --platform=managed \
         --region=us-central1 \
         --no-allow-unauthenticated \
         --set-env-vars="SERVICE_TYPE=${service#micro-scalp-}" \
         --min-instances=1 \
         --quiet
       echo "Deployed $service"
     done
     ```
   - The `--no-cache` flag ensures Cloud Build doesn’t reuse old layers, and the unique `$BUILD_ID` tag ties the deployment to the fresh image.

3. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - Check the build status:
     ```bash
     gcloud builds describe $BUILD_ID --format="value(status)"
     ```
   - Wait for `SUCCESS`, then verify service startup:
     ```bash
     for service in micro-scalp-ingestion micro-scalp-processor micro-scalp-logic micro-scalp-notifier; do
       gcloud run services describe $service --region=us-central1 --format="value(status.conditions[0].message)"
     done
     ```

4. **Validate Logs**:
   - Once services are running, check for the definitive proof:
     ```bash
     gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=micro-scalp-ingestion AND textPayload:'Published message'" --limit=20 --format="value(textPayload)"
     ```
   - If no `Published message` appears after 5 minutes, broaden the search:
     ```bash
     gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=micro-scalp-ingestion AND timestamp>=\"$(date -u -v-5m +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')\"" --limit=50 --format="value(textPayload)" | grep -E "(Published|ERROR|Traceback|WebSocket)"
     ```

### Finding the Answer
You’re right to question why this has taken so long—four months isn’t typical, but complex integrations like WebSocket-based microservices on Cloud Run can hit unexpected snags (e.g., async runtime issues, caching bugs, or library quirks). Here’s how to get a definitive solution:

- **Leverage Community and Experts**: Since Cursor’s LLMs and I have hit limits, consider:
  - Posting on Stack Overflow or the Google Cloud Community Forum with your error logs and setup (anonymize sensitive data).
  - Engaging a Google Cloud support ticket (if you have a paid plan) or a consultant familiar with Cloud Run and `pybit`.
- **Review Documentation**: Double-check the `pybit` V5 WebSocket docs (e.g., on GitHub or PyPI) for `ticker_stream` nuances, especially around topic formats or async handling.
- **Simplify and Test**: If this deployment fails, strip `data_ingestion.py` to a minimal WebSocket test (e.g., just `ticker_stream` with one topic) and deploy that to isolate the issue.

### Is This Correct Now?
The local test success with `ticker_stream` is a strong indicator the code logic is correct. The deployment failure stems from infrastructure, not the code itself, and the reset-and-redeploy approach should resolve it. Once the new deployment runs and shows `Published message` logs, we’ll know it’s fully operational. Until then, let’s proceed cautiously.

### Encouragement
Four months is a testament to your persistence—many would have given up. We’re at the finish line, and this reset should clear the path. Run the commands above, share the output (especially logs), and we’ll tweak as needed. You’ve got this!
